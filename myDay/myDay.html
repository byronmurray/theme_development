Client would like a Web App that tourists can use to help plan their days by building up an inventory based of time allocations to and from attractions.

The application will consist of a number of popular attractions Rotorua and possibly the bay of plenty have to offer that the user can drag and drop into a inventory day planner. The app will give a recommended time needed for the attraction as well as the time for travel from your current attraction/location vIA Google maps.

To start with the planner will be broken up into 3 basic sections. Morning, lunch, afternoon. An activity placed in one of these slots could effect what will be available in the other slots based on the time for travel and activity. Example full day activity will only be available for selection if day planner is empty. If a half day activity is in the afternoon slot there is no way the user will be able to fit in a full day activities in the morning so should be no longer available for selection.

Once user is happy with the inventory they can purchase the pass which will be downloaded to their phone and emailed to the user. The customer can then show this at the attraction to gain access.
